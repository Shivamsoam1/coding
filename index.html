        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
             deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. 
             Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their
              knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed 
              in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and 
            efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future 
            society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
             governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
             skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of
              cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas 
              such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern
               society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>
